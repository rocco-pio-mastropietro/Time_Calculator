# time-calculator

This i one of the required projects to earn my Scientific Computing with Python certification by freeCodeCamp.
For this project, I wrote a function named add_time that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter:
  a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM);
  a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes;
  (optional) a starting day of the week, case insensitive.
The function adds the duration time to the start time and return the result.
